# Live demo

Changes are automatically rendered as you type.

* Implements [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual, "native" React DOM elements
* Allows you to escape or skip HTML (try toggling the checkboxes above)
* If you escape or skip the HTML, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used! Yay!

## Table of Contents

## HTML block below

<blockquote>
  This blockquote will change based on the HTML settings above.
</blockquote>

## How about some code?

```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
```

Pretty neat, eh?
